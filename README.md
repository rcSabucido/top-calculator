# Calculator Project: TOP Foundations

This project marks the end of my TOP foundations course. I have finished the foundation course on January 24, 2025, in the middle of my 2nd year. I started this course at the end of my 12th year in High School. 

Since then, I have learned a lot of things concerning web development. I will continue to hone my skills in programming for years to come. With that said, I am happy to conclude this small chapter in my life, which is the TOP foundations course.
